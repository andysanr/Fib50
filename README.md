# Fib50
The program uses a recursive function to calculate and print the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number (50 in this case). The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The program prints out the sequence by calling the recursive function with each number in the sequence.
